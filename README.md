# Web Projects by Alex Lay

- [Six Degrees of Agent Coulson](/Six-Degrees-of-Agent-Coulson/) - Generate "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" style connection chains and statistics for different characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
- [Stormlight "women's script"](https://aclay.github.io/stormlight-womens-script/) - Convert text to the script used in illustrations from Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive. The name comes from it being a cultural taboo for men to read or write in the world the books are set in.

Source code for these can be found on [my github profile](https://github.com/ACLay).
